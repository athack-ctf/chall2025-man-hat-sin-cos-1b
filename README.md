> A brief description of the challenge (For the @hacks team only): goal is to use Google Dorking to find the information--or use part1A for a simple search. Part1A makes part 2 easier, but participants can start with part2 if they want (it will just be a bit harder)

## Description (for the challenge)
Shifting away from the photograph on Dr.Dexter's desk, you weren't surprised to find out that he is such a DORK by the D&D dice laying near his laptop.
Yet, one thing peaks your interest...
It turns out that Dr. Dexter was acquainted with the family of a forgotten genius who revolutionized most of the technologies used in nuclear reactors today. This Mathematician had their autobiography written in an Alumnae publication issued by the University where they earned their BA. 

The flag is the concatenation of the TWO first words from the name of the Universityâ€™s journal publication (lowercase). Example: if the name is Hello Worldâ€™s Daily, your Flag would be ATHACKCTF{helloworlds}

Hint: the source found at Part1A will help you solve this challenge
